This JavaScript library (`UdioPlayer.js`) provides a complete solution for game developers to search and play audio from Udio's API. Here's what it does:

1. **Universal Module Definition (UMD)**: Works in browsers, AMD, and CommonJS environments

2. **Core Features**:
   - Search Udio API by keywords, tags or specific criteria
   - Play, pause, stop, and control audio playback
   - Advanced loop features (section looping, repetitions)
   - Volume and playback rate control
   - Event system for hooking into playback events
   - Genre-specific search and random playback

3. **CORS Handling**:
   - Uses a CORS proxy by default to handle potential cross-origin restrictions
   - Can be configured to use direct requests if CORS is properly set up on the server

4. **Audio Controls**:
   - Play/pause/stop/resume
   - Volume control
   - Playback rate adjustment
   - Seeking within tracks
   - Regular looping and section looping

5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all methods
   - TypeDef definitions for parameter objects

### Usage Examples:

```javascript
// Create a player instance
const player = new UdioPlayer();

// Play a track by genre
player.playRandomByGenre('rock').then(() => {
  console.log('Now playing a rock track');
});

// Search for specific tracks
player.search({
  tags: ['ambient', 'electronic'],
  maxResults: 5
}).then(tracks => {
  console.log('Found tracks:', tracks);
  
  if (tracks.length > 0) {
    // Play the first track with options
    player.play(tracks[0], { 
      volume: 0.8, 
      loop: true
    });
  }
});

// Loop a specific section 5 times then continue
player.play('ambient').then(() => {
  player.loopSection({
    startTime: 10, 
    endTime: 30,
    repetitions: 5
  });
});

// Add event listeners
player.addEventListener('ended', () => {
  console.log('Track playback ended');
});
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Multiple CORS strategies**:
   - Public CORS proxies with automatic fallbacks
   - Web Worker approach that can bypass some CORS restrictions
   - JSONP implementation as a last resort for GET requests

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Graceful fallbacks through multiple layers
   - Caching of successful searches
   - Demo tracks as ultimate fallback

3. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Request caching to reduce API calls
   - More efficient proxy selection

4. **Audio element improvements**:
   - Set crossOrigin attribute to "anonymous" to better handle CORS for audio

## How to Use

Initialize the player with your preferred CORS handling mode:

```javascript
const player = new UdioPlayer({
  corsMode: 'auto',  // 'auto', 'proxy', or 'direct'
  maxRetries: 3      // Number of proxy attempts before giving up
});

This library provides a complete solution for integrating Udio's audio content into games while handling all the complexities of audio playback control and API interaction.
